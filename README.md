# js-wasm-metering

Simple wasm metering.

This is a fork of https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aldea/wasm-metering?activeTab=readme with some modifications to make more truncate opcodes work. This in turn is just a wrapper around https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp-wasm-metering, but we moved most of the code inside this repository.

There is also code adapted from https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp-wasm-json-toolkit.
